## Technical Architecture

### Files Created/Modified

#### Schemas (`src/schemas/`)
- **users.ts** (NEW): User validation schemas
  - `createUserSchema`: Validate new user creation
  - `updateUserSchema`: Validate user updates
- **organizations.ts** (MODIFIED): Added update schema
  - `updateOrganizationSchema`: Validate organization updates

#### Services (`src/services/`)
- **users.ts** (MODIFIED): User business logic
  - `createUser()`: Create new user
  - `updateUser()`: Update existing user
  - `userEmailExists()`: Check email uniqueness
  - `validateUserCreation()`: Business rule validation
  - `validateUserUpdate()`: Business rule validation
  
- **organizations.ts** (MODIFIED): Organization business logic
  - `updateOrganization()`: Update organization details
  - `validateOrganizationUpdate()`: Business rule validation
  - `getOrganizationUsers()`: Paginated user listing with search/filter
  - Added `OrganizationUserSearchParams` type
  - Added `OrganizationUser` type

#### Server Actions (`src/app/(protected)/(super-admin)/orgs/[orgId]/`)
- **actions.ts** (NEW): Server actions for org page
  - `createUserAction()`: Handle user creation

  - All actions follow the standard server action pattern with:
    - Permission checks (SUPER_ADMIN only)

  - Fetches paginated users with search/filter params
  - Handles search params from URL
  - Passes data to view component

#### View Components (`src/views/organizations/`)
- **OrganizationDetailView.tsx** (NEW): Main view component
  - Orchestrates all sub-components
  - Manages dialog open/close states
  - Displays breadcrumb, org details card, and tabs

- **CreateUserDialog.tsx** (NEW): User creation dialog
  - Form with name, email, role fields
  - Uses `useActionState` for form state management
  - Auto-closes on successful submission

- **EditUserDialog.tsx** (NEW): User edit dialog
  - Form with name and role (email read-only)
  - Uses `useActionState` for form state management
  - Auto-closes on successful submission

- **EditOrganizationDialog.tsx** (NEW): Organization edit dialog
  - Form with name and description
  - Uses `useActionState` for form state management
  - Auto-closes on successful submission

- **UsersTable.tsx** (NEW): User table with search/filter/pagination
  - Client component with interactive features
  - Search bar for filtering users
  - Role filter dropdown
  - Pagination controls
  - Edit button for each user
  - Badge styling based on role (color-coded)

#### UI Components
- **dialog.tsx** (NEW): Added shadcn/ui dialog component for modal dialogs

## Data Flow

### Creating a User
1. User clicks "Create User" button → Opens dialog
2. User fills form → Submits
3. `createUserAction` validates and processes:
   - Checks permissions (SUPER_ADMIN)
   - Validates schema (Zod)
   - Checks business rules (email uniqueness)
   - Creates user in database
   - Revalidates page cache
4. Dialog closes, table refreshes with new user

### Editing a User
1. User clicks "Edit" button in table → Opens dialog with user data
2. User modifies form → Submits
3. `updateUserAction` validates and processes:
   - Checks permissions (SUPER_ADMIN)
   - Validates schema (Zod)
   - Updates user in database
   - Revalidates page cache
4. Dialog closes, table refreshes with updated data

### Editing Organization
1. User clicks "Edit Organization" button → Opens dialog with org data
2. User modifies form → Submits
3. `updateOrganizationAction` validates and processes:
   - Checks permissions (SUPER_ADMIN)
   - Validates schema (Zod)
   - Checks business rules (name uniqueness, excluding current)
   - Updates organization in database
   - Revalidates page caches
4. Dialog closes, page refreshes with updated data

### Search/Filter/Pagination
1. User interacts with search/filter/pagination controls
2. Client-side updates URL search params
3. Next.js re-renders server component with new params
4. Server fetches filtered/paginated data
5. View component displays updated results

## Validation & Error Handling

### Schema Validation (Zod)
- **User Creation**:
  - Name: 2-100 characters
  - Email: Valid email format, max 255 characters
  - Role: Valid enum value (USER, ORG_ADMIN, SUPER_ADMIN)
  - OrganizationId: Valid CUID

- **User Update**:
  - Name: 2-100 characters (optional)
  - Role: Valid enum value (optional)

- **Organization Update**:
  - Name: 2-100 characters (optional)
  - Description: 10-500 characters when provided (optional)

### Business Rules
- **User Creation**: Email must be unique across all users
- **Organization Update**: Name must be unique (excluding current org)

### Error Display
- Field-level errors shown below each input
- General form errors shown at top of form
- Form data preserved on validation errors

## Security

- **Authorization**: All actions require SUPER_ADMIN role
- **Input Validation**: All inputs validated with Zod schemas
- **Business Logic**: Enforced in service layer
- **SQL Injection**: Protected by Prisma ORM
- **CSRF**: Protected by Next.js server actions

## UI/UX Features

### Responsive Design
- Mobile-friendly layout with stacked search/filter on small screens
- Responsive table with proper overflow handling
- Dialog components centered and properly sized

### User Feedback
- Loading states during form submission ("Creating...", "Updating...")
- Success states (dialog auto-close)
- Error states (inline validation messages)
- Disabled form controls during submission

### Visual Hierarchy
- Color-coded role badges:
  - SUPER_ADMIN: Destructive (red)
  - ORG_ADMIN: Default (blue)
  - USER: Secondary (gray)
- Clear section headers and descriptions
- Consistent spacing and typography

## Testing Recommendations

1. **User Creation**:
   - ✅ Create user with valid data
   - ✅ Create user with duplicate email (should fail)
   - ✅ Create user with invalid email format (should fail)
   - ✅ Try without SUPER_ADMIN role (should be unauthorized)

2. **User Update**:
   - ✅ Update user name
   - ✅ Update user role
   - ✅ Verify email cannot be changed

3. **Organization Update**:
   - ✅ Update organization name
   - ✅ Update organization description
   - ✅ Update with duplicate name (should fail)

4. **Search & Filter**:
   - ✅ Search by user name
   - ✅ Search by email
   - ✅ Search by user ID
   - ✅ Filter by each role
   - ✅ Combine search and filter
   - ✅ Clear search/filter

5. **Pagination**:
   - ✅ Navigate between pages
   - ✅ Change page size
   - ✅ Verify correct item counts
   - ✅ Check pagination resets on search/filter

## Future Enhancements

1. **Additional Tabs**: Add tabs for:
   - Activity log
   - Settings
   - Analytics
   - Billing (if applicable)

2. **Bulk Operations**:
   - Bulk user import/export
   - Bulk role updates
   - Bulk delete

3. **Advanced Filtering**:
   - Date range filters
   - Multiple role selection
   - Custom saved filters

4. **User Actions**:
   - Delete user
   - Suspend/activate user
   - Send invitation email
   - Reset user password

5. **Audit Trail**:
   - Track who made changes
   - Track when changes were made
   - View change history

## Notes

- The implementation follows the project's server actions pattern documented in `docs/SERVER-ACTIONS-GUIDE.md`
- All components use shadcn/ui for consistent styling
- Server components handle data fetching, client components handle interactivity
- Cache revalidation ensures data stays fresh after mutations
- TypeScript provides full type safety across all layers
